        "description": "Implement a robust error handling system across the application, including toast notifications, React error boundaries, and user-friendly fallback UIs, while eliminating `console.error()` as the sole error reporting mechanism.",
        "details": "1.  **Error Boundary Implementation:** Utilize a library like `react-error-boundary` or implement custom class-based error boundaries. Strategically place error boundaries around major application sections (e.g., main content areas, complex widgets, data-fetching components) to prevent a single component failure from crashing the entire app. Design and implement visually distinct and informative fallback UIs for each boundary, providing options like 'Reload Page' or 'Contact Support'.\n2.  **Toast Notification System:** Choose and integrate a suitable toast notification library (e.g., `react-hot-toast`, `notistack`). Create a global `ToastProvider` or context to manage toast state. Develop a utility function or hook (e.g., `useToast`) to easily trigger success, error, warning, and info toasts from any component or service. Ensure toasts are accessible (ARIA attributes), have appropriate durations, and are dismissible.\n3.  **Centralized Error Logging & Reporting:** Integrate with an error monitoring service (e.g., Sentry, Bugsnag, LogRocket) to capture and report uncaught exceptions and errors from error boundaries. Replace direct `console.error()` calls with calls to this logging service or a wrapper function that also triggers user-facing notifications where appropriate. Ensure sensitive information is not logged.\n4.  **API Error Handling Standardization:** Implement global Axios interceptors or similar mechanisms for `fetch` API calls to catch and process HTTP errors (e.g., 4xx, 5xx). Map specific HTTP status codes or backend error messages to user-friendly toast notifications. Handle common scenarios like authentication failures (401 - redirect to login), not found (404 - show specific message/page), and server errors (500 - generic error message). If using TanStack Query (from Task 13), leverage its error handling capabilities (`onError` callbacks, `useErrorBoundary`).\n5.  **Form and Input Validation Errors:** Ensure client-side validation errors are displayed inline with the input fields. For server-side validation errors, display them clearly to the user, either as a toast or as a summary at the top of the form.",
        "testStrategy": "1.  **Unit & Component Tests:** Write tests for the `ToastProvider` and `useToast` hook to ensure correct rendering and behavior of notifications. Test custom error boundary components: verify they catch errors from children and render the fallback UI. Mock error logging to ensure it's called. Test utility functions for API error parsing and message generation.\n2.  **Integration Tests:** Simulate runtime errors within components (e.g., by throwing an error in a mocked function) and assert that the nearest error boundary catches it and displays the fallback UI. Mock API responses to return various error codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500) and verify that the correct toast notifications appear and/or the UI reacts appropriately (e.g., redirect on 401). Verify that `console.error()` calls are replaced by calls to the centralized logging service.\n3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Develop E2E scenarios that intentionally trigger errors in different parts of the application (e.g., submitting invalid forms, attempting unauthorized actions, simulating network failures). Assert that the user experience is graceful: correct error messages are displayed, the application doesn't crash, and fallback UIs are functional. Verify that errors are correctly reported to the integrated error monitoring service.\n4.  **Code Review & Static Analysis:** Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure `console.error()` is not used for production-critical error reporting. Utilize static analysis tools (ESLint rules) to flag direct `console.error()` usage.",
